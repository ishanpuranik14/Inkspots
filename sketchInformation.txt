Arushi,

Sorry, I couldn't access the original documentation and hence couldn't give it to you.The one seen below is a rough one.
Depending on your system's architechture(32 bit or 64 bit), run the 'Inkspots.exe' file in 'application.windows32'/ 'application.windows64' folder.(the code is in their 'source' subfolder)I'll tell you about this in brief.Each node is a course(Math, science) and the graph shows the prerequisite relationships between them(e.g english is a prereq for science and so on).
It also shows the extra info attached to each node on clicking. a node and its children can be isolated to analyze them separately.The nodes are displayed in a heirarchical manner as a tree.
click on the whitespace and drag to view different portions of the graph.

This is the InkSpots Graph Visualizer built by Ishan Puranik in June 2014.
The current version accepts a particular data format, and suits the needs of Snapwiz Edutech Inc, India 
which is a subsidiary of Snapwiz Inc, USA, where I work as a summer intern(mid May 2014 - mid July 2014).
The code skeleton can be altered to suit various input format and functionality requirements.
Currently it comes with a set of basic functionalities :
1. press 't' to toggle colour modes
2. Press 'e' to show/ hide edges
3. press 's' to store the current Frame as 'graph.png'
4. nodes can be dragged using left mouse button
5. nodes along with 1st level children can be dragged together using the right mouse button.
6. The graph can be explored by dragging the mouse on the canvas.
7. yellow lines show the children aand pink show the parents.


for more details, you can view the 2-3 page documentation. It gives a better picture.
Enjoy playing with it!
